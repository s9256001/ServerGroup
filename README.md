An experimental server group for a mobile game.  
It uses the supersocket lib for the underlying socket connection.  
This project is developed in vs 2013, and use the nuget lib to get the entityframework and newtonjson libs.  
It consists of three servers: LoginServer for login, CacheServer for the central database communication, and RegionServer for the load balance of the game flow.
